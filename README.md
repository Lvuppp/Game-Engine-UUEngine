This repository develops a software tool for creating 3D computer games, based on its own game engine. 

# Software tool
The software tool for creating computer games will implement basic tools for creating games.

# Game Engine
The game engine will allow to perform various basic operations on objects (moving, rotating, resizing). The same game engine will provide basic objects such as cube, ball and so on. There will be implemented basic physics for various ideal objects, for example for inelastic solid body will be implemented gravitation force, impulse, but elastic force will not be implemented for it. There will also be created various physical quantities that can be turned off, such as kinetic energy or potential energy. Basic classes for working with the scene, camera, lighting will be implemented.
